# LangChain_QA_Test
A proof-of-concept chatbot built for a prospective employer 

This is a proof of concept work designed to show a chat bot that can answer questions about documents in a specified Google drive folder, but also answer the types of questions that are commonly asked of ChatGPT. This notebook is not ready out-of-the-box, you would have to set your own Google drive folder ID within the code, in addition to obtaining your own API key from open AI, and a lot more set up for the Google API and Auth0 system.
