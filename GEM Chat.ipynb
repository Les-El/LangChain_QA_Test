      "AI: In March 2023, there is a global trend away from coal in the energy sector, with a significant reduction in proposed new coal power capacity outside of China. If this trend continues, it could have implications for reducing CO2 emissions. It is important to continue increasing momentum away from coal and consider alternatives. However, India's plans for increased coal power capacity create uncertainty for its future role in reducing emissions. The U.S. is leading in coal retirements, but other countries such as Turkey, Ukraine, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam still rely heavily on coal power. While there are some last resort measures being taken in the European Union and United Kingdom, coal is not making a comeback overall.\n",

      "AI: As of March 2023, the global coal power sector saw a net increase in capacity with 45.5 GW of new coal power commissioned in 2022 and 26 GW of coal power retired. Despite the trend of global coal power capacity outside China decreasing every year since 2018, the dominance of China's coal power sector continues, with many individual Chinese provinces topping the capacity additions of entire countries. Inner Mongolia (6 GW) surpassed India (3.5 GW) despite India being the country with the most coal commissioned in 2022 after China. In fact, Inner Mongolia nearly had more new capacity than the next two countries after China combined (India and Japan). The European Union and the U.S. saw a decrease in the rate of retirements. Six countries phased out coal power, while four retired or converted more coal power than they commissioned. Therefore, China's dominance is expected to continue into 2023, and beyond, when looking at the coal power capacity being developed.\n",

      "AI: As of March 2023, the global energy sector still heavily relies on coal power capacity, particularly in China, despite a global trend of decreasing coal power capacity. However, positive developments such as 18 non-OECD countries scrapping their proposed coal projects and nine countries formally committing to No New Coal via the Powering Past Coal Alliance or No New Coal Power Compact indicate a shift towards greener energy choices. The pre-construction capacity for coal has decreased by 83% since 2015 outside of China, with only three countries in the OECD/EU still considering new coal projects. Australia and Japan each have a small coal project under consideration, and Turkey has more than one proposed coal project.
